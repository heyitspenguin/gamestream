Game streaming is a type of [online gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game "Online game") that allows direct and on-demand video [streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing) "Stream (computing)") of games onto computers, consoles, and mobile devices, similar to [video on demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand "Video on demand"), through the use of a [thin client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client "Thin client"). 

The actual game is stored, executed, and rendered on the remote operator's or game company's [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") and the video results are streamed directly to a consumer's computers over the Internet. 

This allows access to games without the need of a [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console "Video game console") or high-end gaming computers and largely makes the [capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second "Instructions per second") of the user's computer unimportant, as the server is the system that is running the processing needs. 

The controls and button presses from the user are transmitted directly to the server, where they are recorded, and the server then sends back the game's response to the input controls.
